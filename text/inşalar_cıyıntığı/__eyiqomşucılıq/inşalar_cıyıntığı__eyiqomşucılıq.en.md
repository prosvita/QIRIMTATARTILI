# Good-neighbourliness

__A collection of essays__

The United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees is a humanitarian organisation devoted to protecting and assisting the world’s refugees.

Refugees are people who were forced to leave their country of origin.
One of the major reasons why people become refugees is because of conflict resulting from ethnic tensions.
UNHCR has also been provided by the United Nations General Assembly with the responsibility of preventing statelessness.
Statelessness means that a person is not a citizen of any country and therefore cannot make use of the rights and privileges of being a citizen.
In Crimea, UNHCR, supports the government of Ukraine in implementing procedures to prevent statelessness and highlighting the benefits of citizenship.
Together with Governments and other organizations, UNHCR develops and supports prevention activities which contribute to reducing the potential for future conflict.
The use of these school books in the context of the UNHCR/DRC Tolerance Education Project in Crimea, and with the active participation of students, will assist in reducing intolerance and thus reduce the likelihood of people becoming refugees in the first place.
The Tolerance Education Project is also being conducted in the Kyrgyz Republic.

## Home museum

__Osmanova Maye, 15 years old, Junkoi city__

I’m Maye Osmanova, I’m Crimean Tatar, I’m in the 10-th form.
 I have not lived wise life full of years yet, I have not caught the truth of history, have not gone deep into the discussions of politicians.
I look at this world with half-open eyes, take my first independent steps, try to estimate the present events carefully.

Taking part in the competition «Good-neighbourliness» I don’t hope to win, to get a money prize, no.
I just want to share that feeling of gratitude, that joy of communication with friends.
That inspiration when one wants to be better, kinder, to bring more joy to the people he communicates with.

When we came to the Crimea from Andigan I was 6 and my sister Lera was 3.
We had not neither grandmother nor grandfather near by.
They were substituted by our neighbours — Ljuba and Arkasha, they were Russians.
Since those days they have given us their love and care. 
And it hurts and frightens me to hear when the adults blame the Russians for all our troubles demanding their punishment and deportation.

According to my parents’ memory, in 1988 when we left for Djankoy the relations with the Crimean Tatars were very strained.

And Andrey, an Ukrainian, was the first who gave a hand of friendship and assistance to my father at work.
When he visited us with his wife Katya, we had a real holiday.

How pleasant it was when Ira, a great friend of our family, came and congratulated us with Moslem holiday «Kurban bayram» in the Tatar language, kissing my mother’s and father’s hands and pronouncing the words of congratulation with great difficulty but so proudly.

Once on the lesson of history the teacher told us about the deportation of Crimean Tatars from Crimea.
Аnd the reasons — the betrayal of the Crimean Tatar people during the Great Patriotic War.
I was the only Crimean Tatar in our class.
I was ashamed and terrified,I came home in tears and I was afraid to go to school the next day.
And then my mother showed me our small «home museum », where the letters from the War were kept: yellow pages written in an even, fine, nice handwriting either in Russian or in Latin — my grandfather’s letters.
She showed me an article from the newspaper «Pravda» from September 25, 1954.
«Captain Ablyalimov Server Ablyalimovitch is awarded an order of the Patriotic War Second Class » .
And « killed in battle» notice from 14.06.1949: «Guards captain deputy battalion commander Ablyalimov Server Ablyalimovitch in battle for the Socialist Motherland, faithful to oath of allegiance, having displayed heroism and courage, was killed on 26.03.1945 and buried with military honours.
Gospodskiy Dvor, Hungary».

The next day I would not feel hurt with the word «traitors», I went with confidence, I was proud of my people.
And how grateful I am to the pupils of my class that they had never reminded me about that, never humiliated me and never offended me with that «accusation».

They appeared to be wiser than the teacher.
And  from the adults which demand retribution for everything but we, their children and grandchildren, will be punished.
And we, on the contrary, want to live in friendship,to bring only benefit to our Crimea, to revive it.
It belongs not to the past but to the present and future, it means that it belongs to us — children.
The Crimea is a beauty and one mustn’t darken this beauty with evil, misfortune and war.

I suggest to hold «Forum of Friendship» on the Day of Children Defence.
It will be great showholiday,the children of different nationalities living in Crimea in their national costumes would tell the history, culture and customs of their peoples, dancing and singing,then they would join hands, make a big round dance, go around the city, sing the same song in different languages.
It should be a song about a smile from the cartoon film «Little Racoon».

Maybe we would teach the adults to be friends, to love, to respect each other, not to recollect the past but to live today with hope for a better future.

## Come here, Evelin!

__Pavel Ol'shanskiy, 8 years old, Kerch city__

Last autumn I went to the first form of the gymnasia in my native city-hero Kerch.

In our class there are 30 girls and boys of different nationalities: Avtondy is Georgian, Mary and Mark are Jewish, Yura is German, Gayane is Armenian, Luis is Spanish, many are Russians, I’m Ukrainian.

A girl with a nice name Evelin came to our class.
Evelin is Tatar.
Our teacher offered us to sit at the same desk.
We became friends.
After the lessons we go home together,we walk on the same road.

I carry her bag.

On our way we are talking about the news of past and our plans for future.

Once in one the of week-ends Evelin invited me to visit her family and I met her relatives: father, mother, little brother, grandfather and grandmother.
We were sitting at a beautiful table, drinking tea with pie and treating ourselves to fruit.

I knew from Evelin’s grandfather and grandmother ,I found out where they came from.
They had come to our Kerch from the far Middle Asia.
But many years ago, when Evelin and her little brother were not yet born, they lived here, in Crimea, for many-many years.

But on June 22, 1941 the Great Patriotic war began,on May 18, 1944 the Tatar population of Crimea was subjected to deportation, it meant the expulsion from its native land.

A lot of destroyed deserted villages and farms disappeared from the map of our peninsular.

Now the deported peoples are coming back to Crimea, their Motherland.

More than 70 nations and nationalities live in Kerch.

I recollect very often how Evelin and me were walking in winter to the sea to feed hungry, freezing swans,they come to us to spend the winter.

And last summer Evelin left for Moscow.
I miss her a lot.

Come here, Evelin, next summer!

## Pigeons

__Galina Rudenko, 11 years old, village Lobanovo__

Our village was founded by the Czechs.
It was even called Bogemka.
Recently it celebrated its 135-th anniversary and the guests from Czech Republic came to our school.

The school director warned us: «Children, don’t forget that you are cultured people!»

«But how shall we understand them?»

«You’ll understand», — Yulia Pavlovna smiled.

And soon they came — young men and women.
We greeted them and they were smiling, speaking their language and shaking hands.
While walking around the school they were admiring its beauty and cosiness, saying: «0-o?» and smiling.
And we understood again — they liked our place.
And when we sang a song for them they were applauding cheerfully.
The director was right, if you want to understand a friend you’ll do it.

Though in real life sometimes it’s rather difficult to gain an understanding.
My friend Zarinka has a grandmother who likes to explain everything to us.
Once I asked her: «Why did you come to Crimea and leave your lived-in places?» And she so wisely explained to me that a man had such a nature: on strange land the apples may be of two-fists size while on native land — only burrs, but there is no better place than the native land.

I remember, when I was in the 1-st form, our teacher read us that some pigeons were once sold from Kiev to Irkutsk.
During two years they were flying home.
There was a nice pigeon-loft in the new place, they had nourishing food but that nest was not native.
So, probably, people can’t live without Motherland.

In our village the Czechs, Ukrainians, Russians, Tatars live in friendship and for all of them our village is a native one, for all of them it’s Motherland.
Maybe there are some villages better than ours but for us it is the dearest.

## Friendship has won

__Bahman Vlad, 16 years old, Feodosia city__

Our world is created in such a way that we live among the people of different nationalities.
It is clearly seen in our big home — Crimea.
Russians and Ukrainians, Tatars and Germans, Bulgarians, Greeks, Jewish, Armenians and many other people became good neighbours.
It is known for a long time that one has not to choose a friend because of his eyes, hair and skin colour.
The nationalities can’t be good or bad.
Only concrete people can be good or bad.

I’m German as to my nationality and I’d like to tell a story of the Crimean Germans.
The grandfathers of our grandfathers came to Russia long-long ago.
They were famous for their skills and knowledge.
They were respected for their industry and love for order.
Russia, Ukraine and Crimea became a homeland for them.
Many years Germans lived in friendship with other peoples of their new Motherland, they worked and rested together.

But a great trouble came to all peoples — the Second World War began.
All the representatives of German nationality were considered to be enemies because of the worst part of them.

The day of August 18, 1941 became a terrible day for the

Crimean Germans.
They were put into the goods cars sent to Siberia, the Ural, Khazahstan.
During the long way a lot of people died of cold, hunger and troubles.
Those who survived found themselves in forest, field, uninhabited places.
By that time the winter frosts had begun but a lot of them hadn’t got warm clothes.
Those who survived even after these severe trials were considered to be enemies for a long time.
A lot of Germans had no opportunity to study, speak their native language, live and work normally.
Only in many years after that Germans and other peoples, who endured such a disaster could return home.

Time cures the wounds.
The friendship of the Germans and other peoples is strengthening.
Recently the Festival of German culture was held in Feodosiya and I took part in it.
This holiday was sincerely greeted by the guests of different nationalities: Russians, Ukrainians, Armenians, Koreans.

The Festival participants and guests acquainted themselves with city history, went sightseeing.
I learned that in Feodosiya in 1941, 50 000 people were killed: the famous Feodosiya landing.
Fascism brought a lot of misfortunes to many peoples.

I know a very impressive poem by Marina Tsvetaeva «Germany».
There are the following lines in it:

O, the girl is the rosiest Among the cold mountains.  
Germany!  
Germany!  
Germany!  
Shame  
Half-map Has pocketed,  
Astral soul!  
In olden days — obscured with the fairy tales,  
Now — is full of tanks...

Those years were shameful for Germany.

Fascism brought a lot of misfortunes.
But it is very offensive for me when some boys and girls of my age sometimes call me a fascist.
Then I try to explain that not all the Germans were fascists.
That’s why now, fifty-six years later, the city could forgive the German people and welcomed them on its land.
The city has forgiven!
It was my best impression of the Festival.
I’m proud of my Motherland.
The friendship has won.

The Festival became a holiday.
We shall build our common Home in Crimea.
You see, we have one common land and one sun, which shines for everybody and warms our friendship.
