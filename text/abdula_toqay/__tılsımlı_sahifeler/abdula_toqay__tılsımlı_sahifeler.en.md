## Native Language

Oh, beloved native language, Oh, enchanting mother tongue!
You enabled my search for knowledge Of the world, since I was young.

As a child, when I was sleepless Mother sung me lullabies
And my grandma told me stories Through the night, to shut my eyes.

Oh, my tongue! You have been always My support in grief and joy,
Understood and cherished fondly Since I was a little boy.

In my tongue, I learned with patience To express my faith and say:
«Oh, Creator! Bless my parents, Take, Allah, my sins away!»

## Work done, have your fun

A fair warm day and, by the window glass, 
A small Boy's reading for tomorrow's class

And through the window glass there calls the Sun: 
«Come out, my Boy! Stop reading! Have some fun!»

The Nightingale sings from the nearby tree:
«Come on, my Boy, come out, have fun with me!»

The Apple-tree, that in the garden stands,
Says: «Boy, have fun, you'll later make amends!»

«No», says the Boy, «I'll catch up with the fun, 
'II never play until my work is done».

The Apple-Tree insists: «You've had your way, 
Don't toil inside — it's such a pleasant day!»

«Just wait for me, be patient, Tree and Sun;
No fun in playing games, when work's undone».

And when the child was through with all his work, 
He left his books, went out for a walk:

«Hey! — said the Boy — who called for me today? 
Through with my studies, I am free to play!»

The Sun then granted him his brightest smile;
The Apple-Tree gave him her nicest apple!

The Nightingale then sang his fairest song to him; 
The trees bowed their heads in front of him.




























## Child and Butterfly

Child:
Tiny little Butterfly,
Will you ever tell me, why,
Flying since the crack of dawn,
You are not fatigued or worn?

Is your living sour or sweet?
How do you make ends meet?
Tell me, where, if you would,
Are you finding ail your food?

Вutterfly:
In the woodlands, in the fields
In the meadows are my yields-
Here's where I fly and play
On a brilliant summer's day.

Loved and cherished by sunligh
I keep flowers in my sight:
Their blossoms, when in bloom,
Nourish me with sweet perfume

Yet, my life is short, I say,
It but lasts a single day,
Be a good and gentle boy,
Do not hurt me, nor destroy!

## Funny student 

Akbai, come on! Be trained! On hind paws stand a bit! 
Don’t fall, don't fall! Stand straight! And now — sit!

— Why do you torment me? I am so small,
Barely three months have passed since I was born!

I am not up for it, I won't be taught, no way.
I only want to roll on grass, have fun and play.

— You silly puppy! Learn, while you're still small,
It gets so harder, as the years roll.

## Ali and the Goat

The Goat’s, to Gali, a dear friend;
Into the window pane she sticks her head. 
Gali plays host and gives her grass for food: 
The Goat shakes her beard in gratitude.

## Naughty cat

Look, Lamiga is now engrossed in sewing.
A garment for her doll — that's what she's doing! 
«When will I have it?» — asks the doll, reclining; 
«I cannot wait — the holiday is coming».

The cat meanwhile is staring at the bobbin:
«Will it now move — will it at last start rolling?» 
And then she'll bounce and grab it, as a ball, 
And she will chase it 'round, just let it roll!

She has no other worry but to play:
Mischievous, drolly cat! She'd play all day!

## Lazy puppy 

Our puppy lives a good life, no complains.
He gaily barks and runs, all day he plays;
He looks at me with eyes so full of love,
As if he means to say: «Let's play and laugh!»

At times he rests — when he's been nicely fed, 
On his fore paws, he reclines his head.
Flies come to bother him, yet in sweet dreams 
He doesn't want to know, so it seems.

Such lazy puppy! Staring from below,
His half-closed eyes then seem to keenly glow; 
He widely yawns and moves to scratch his ear, 
And all the flies instantly disappear.

## A mouse that fell into a bowl of milk

I don’t know how or why, but this I’m told,
A little caged mouse fell into a bowl

Of milk, swam back and forth, could not escape, 
The milk was liquid, drowning was her fate.

All frantic motion, where will she be safe?
She’s paddling here and there, she keeps her faith.

Her work was not in vain, I’m pleased to utter,
She swam so long, that milk turned into butter

And for a moment you could see her standing there 
Then, she leapt off and ran into her lair.

My dearest one! If you are treading that same bowl, 
Be patient, stoic, don’t forget your goal.

## Morning 

At dawn the world awakens, 
and The East inflames and goes red,
The Sun comes out and its beams 
Fall down to warm up the land.

The town streets become alive,
As fields and forests nearby,
Hills, gardens and the town yards 
All bathe in sunlight of the sky.

The townsfolk is wide awake,
In every place they cook and bake. 
The birds in flocks into the sky 
Take wing for the Almighty's sake.

And children in the morning chill 
Are off to school after the meal,
With full schoolbags at their backs, 
They go to learn with hope and zeal.

## The Moon ana tne Sun

There is a golden cradle in the Himalayan heights,
The one who sleeps in it is guarded through the night. 
When the Sun is rising, the Wind is already there 
Praising the Sun's entrance, the world must be aware.

The Wind serves as a herald whose duty is to say: 
«The Sun's already up, greet another day!»
And when the Sun is out, performing his daily race,
Crescent, his young brother, takes the cradle's space.

Never left alone, he's surrounded by the stars, 
Like the tiniest of torches, they shine from afar.
Crescent in the cradle sleeps for the entire night,
Till the Sun awakens Him with early morning light.

Day comes after night, brother comes after brother,
While one of them rests, he can count on the other.



## The Rain and the Sun

«For always shall I shine», the Sun has said, 
«For I shall glow and never shall I set».

The Rain has said «I shall be pouring every day,
The black land shall be moist for I shall cry my way»

The Sun then has replied to him: «You're very wet, 
You pour and dirty all things get.

And marshes then appear here and there,
All you know to make the dirt appear everywhere.

Because of all this moisture rot the crops,
And all men wish that you would stop».

The Rain then has replied: «You become hot,
You burn the crop down and destroy the lot».

Offended with the words the Sun's become,
All strength of heat and anger's lost the Sun.

He said: «А chance to ripen I give to the fruit,
Due to my shine all nature sees it's good».

«You help them ripen, — said the Rain,
But I'm the one who gives them water.

If I pour not, the gardens then will start to fade,
The meadows and the green land shall be withered»

The Sun and the Rain after arguing for hours,
After dishonoring and tarnishing each other,

Made peace at last and came up with a deal,
That never again shall one speak of another ill.

Thus, their arguing came to an end,
And then they have decided they would alternate.

The Sun has said: «I now shall shine only in my turn, 
And you shall rain down gratefully in yours».

The Sun and the Rain from that day onward,
With no disturbance work on their own accord.

## White Grandpa

It snows — the whole world is snow-white;
The yard, the street, the roof are white and bright, 
All covered in white, our Granddad now returns 
To bring us a variety of toys.

And we are glad, we say: «Thank you, Granddad! 
May God grant you many more years ahead!» 
Granddad, poor thing, be rain or shine, in white 
At all times brings us joy, thrill and delight.

## Winter evening

Kids, what a fun it is, this winter's night!
It's warm; the oven fire's burning bright.
You're sitting tightly, not afraid of cold;
You're joyful — not a worry in the world.

And none of you no anguish ever knew,
You're sitting pretty, nothing troubles you, 
Immersed into your mother's fairy tales,
You do not feel the night, nor winter gales.

Let strong winds gust beyond, and let it snow, 
Let the roof thatch fly forth with every blow;
No bird will venture out, afraid of frost,
But you are warm and fine — no worries lost.

But may at times it cross your tender mind,
Not all enjoy happiness of this kind.
There are some orphan children in the world, 
No land they have, no parents, no abode.

In winter nights, no hope they can hold;
Their cheeks and noses freeze of bitter cold. 
They will be lucky not to ice to death,
For some indeed meet their end like that.

And if you ever see such poor kids,
With eyes in tears, sad, in many needs,
My children! Offer them your love and warmth, 
And comfort them with kind and tender words!

## My village 

Up on the hill, is my village, my aul,
There is a creek, with water pure and cool.
I feel its taste, I know its every part,
I love this place with all my soul and heart.

When I remember that, my eyes fill up with tears 
In memory forever live these childhood years. 
How with my brother in the field we used to plow 
And grains of wheat and rye in soil sow.

I'm still a stranger to this world, but who is not? 
I still have much to learn, to see a lot.
And yet I know but one most sacred rule 
In memory to keep my village, my aul.
